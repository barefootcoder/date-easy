{
	require Date::Parse;
	# Most of this code is stolen from Date::Parse, by Graham Barr.
	#
	# In an ideal world, I would just use the code from there and not repeat it here.  However, the
	# problem is that str2time() calls strptime() to generate the pieces of a datetime, then does
	# some validation, then returns epoch seconds by calling timegm (from Time::Local) on it.  I
	# don't _want_ to call str2time because I'm just going to take the epoch seconds and turn them
	# back into pieces, so it's inefficicent.  But more importantly I _can't_ call str2time because
	# it convertes to UTC, and I want the pieces as they are relative to whatever timezone the
	# parsed date has.
	#
	# On the other hand, the problem with calling strptime directly is that str2time is doing two
	# things there: the conversion to epoch seconds, which I don't want or need, and the validation,
	# which, it turns out, I *do* want, and need.  For instance, strptime will happily return a
	# month of -1 if it hits a parsing hiccough.  Which then strftime will turn into undef, as you
	# would expect.  But, if you're just calling strptime, that doesn't help you much. :-(
	#
	# Thus, I'm left with 3 possibilities, none of them very palatable:
	# 	#	call strptime, then call str2time as well
	#	#	repeat at least some of the code from str2time here
	#	#	do Something Devious, like wrap/monkey-patch strptime
	# #1 doesn't seem practical, because it means that every string that has to be parsed this way
	# has to be parsed twice, meaning it will take twice as long.  #3 seems too complex--since the
	# call to strptime is out of my control, I can't add arguments to it, or get any extra data out
	# of it, which means I have to store things in global variables, which means it wouldn't be
	# reentrant ... it would be a big mess.  So #2, unpalatable as it is, is what we're going with.
	#
	# Of course, this gives me the opportunity to tweak a few things.  For instance, we can tweak
	# the year value to fix RT/105031 (noted below).  Also, since this is only used by our ::Date
	# class, we don't give a crap about times or timezones, so we can totally ignore those parts.
	# (Well, *almost* totally: we still want to verify that we're getting valid values for them.)
	# Which makes this code actually much smaller than its Date::Parse equivalent.
	#
	# On top of that, this is a tiny bit more efficient.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Date::Easy::Date ':all';

    # guaranteed to have a time of midnight
    my $d = date("3-Sep-1940");

    # addition and subtraction work in increments of days
    my $tomorrow = today + 1;
    my $last_week = today - 7;

    my $yr = $d->year;
    my $mo = $d->month;
    my $da = $d->day;
    my $ep = $d->epoch;
    my $qr = $d->quarter;
    my $dw = $d->day_of_week;

    say $d->strftime("%d/%m/%Y");

    my $tp = $d->as('Time::Piece');


=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Date::Easy::Date object is really just a L<Date::Easy::Datetime> object whose time portion is
always guaranteed to be midnight.  In typical usage, you will either use the C<date> constructor to
convert a human-readable string to a date, or the C<today> function to return today's date.  Both
are exported with the C<:all> tag; nothing is exported by default.

Arithmetic operators (plus and minus) either add or subtract days to or from the date object.  All
methods are inherited from Date::Easy::Datetime.

Like their underlying datetime objects, date objects are immutable.

See L<Date::Easy> for more general usage notes.


=head1 USAGE

=head2 Constructors

=head3 Date::Easy::Date->new

Returns the same as L</today>.

=head3 Date::Easy::Date->new($e)

Takes the given epoch seconds, turns it into a datetime (in the local timezone), then throws away
the time portion and constructs a date object with the remainder.

=head3 Date::Easy::Date->new($y, $m, $d)

Takes the given year, month, and day, and turns it into a date object.  Month and day are
human-centric (i.e., 1-based, not 0-based).  Year should probably be a 4-digit year; if you pass in
a 2-digit year, you get whatever century C<timegm> thinks you should get, which may or may not be
what you expected.

=head3 Date::Easy::Date->new($obj)

If the sole argument to C<new> is a blessed object, attempts to convert that object to a date.
Currently the only type of object that can be successfully converted is a L<Time::Piece>.

=head3 today

Returns the current date (in the local timezone).

=head3 date($string)

Takes the human-readable string and converts it to a date using the following heuristics:

=over 4

=item *

If the string consists of exactly 8 digits, and the first two digits are between "10" and "28"
(inclusive), treats it as a compact datestring in the form YYYYMMDD.  Splits it up and passes year,
month, and day to C<new>.

=item *

Otherwise, if the string consists of nothing but digits (including an optional leading negative
sign), treats it as a number of epoch seconds and passes it to C<new>.

=item *

Otherwise, if the string contains no digits at all, removes any timezone specifier, then passes it
to L<Time::ParseDate>'s C<parsedate> function.  If the result is defined, passes the resulting epoch
seconds to C<new>.

=item *

Otherwise if the string contains some digits, passes it to L<Date::Parse>'s C<strptime> function.
If the resulting six values are defined and in the proper ranges, passes the year, month, and day to
C<new>.

=item *

Otherwise if the results of calling C<strptime> are unsatisfactory, removes any timezone specifier,
then passes it to L<Time::ParseDate>'s C<parsedate> function.  If the result is defined, passes the
resulting epoch seconds to C<new>.

=item *

If C<parsedate> returns C<undef> (in either position), throws an "Illegal date" exception.

=back

Though this sounds complicated, most of the time it just does what you meant and you don't need to
think about it.

=head2 Accessors

All accessors are inherited from L<Date::Easy::Datetime>, so refer to those docs.  Note that
C<hour>, C<minute>, and C<second> will always return 0 for a date object, and C<time_zone> will
always return 'UTC'.  Likewise, C<is_local> always returns false and C<is_utc> (and its alias
C<is_gmt>) always return true.

=head2 Other Methods

All other methods are also inherited from L<Date::Easy::Datetime>, so refer to those docs.

=head2 Overloaded Operators

=head3 Addition

You can add an integer value to a date object.  It adds that number of days and returns a new date
object.  The original date is not modified.

=head3 Subtraction

You can subtract an integer value from a date object.  It subtracts that number of days and returns
a new date object.  The original date is not modified.


=head1 BUGS, CAVEATS and NOTES

Because a number like "20090120" can be either a compact datestring (20-Jan-2009) or  a valid number
of epoch seconds (21-Aug-1970 12:35:20), there is a range of epoch seconds that you cannot pass in
via C<date>.  That range is 26-Apr-1970 17:46:40 to 2-Dec-1970 15:33:19.

Any timezone portion specified in a string passed to C<date> is completely ignored.

See also the "Limitations" section in C<Date::Easy>.
