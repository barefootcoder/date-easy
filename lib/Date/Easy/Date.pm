=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Date::Easy::Date ':all';

    # guaranteed to have a time of midnight
    my $d = date("3-Sep-1940");

    # addition and subtraction work in increments of days
    my $tomorrow = today + 1;
    my $last_week = today - 7;
    say "$d was ", today - $d, " days ago";

    my $yr = $d->year;
    my $mo = $d->month;
    my $da = $d->day;
    my $ep = $d->epoch;
    my $qr = $d->quarter;
    my $dw = $d->day_of_week;

    say $d->strftime("%d/%m/%Y");

    my $tp = $d->as('Time::Piece');


=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Date::Easy::Date object is really just a L<Date::Easy::Datetime> object whose time portion is
always guaranteed to be midnight.  In typical usage, you will either use the C<date> constructor to
convert a human-readable string to a date, or the C<today> function to return today's date.  Both
are exported with the C<:all> tag; nothing is exported by default.

Arithmetic operators (plus and minus) either add or subtract days to or from the date object.  All
methods are inherited from Date::Easy::Datetime.

Like their underlying datetime objects, date objects are immutable.

See L<Date::Easy> for more general usage notes.


=head1 USAGE

=head2 Constructors

=head3 Date::Easy::Date->new

Returns the same as L</today>.

=head3 Date::Easy::Date->new($e)

Takes the given epoch seconds, turns it into a datetime (in the local timezone), then throws away
the time portion and constructs a date object with the remainder.

=head3 Date::Easy::Date->new($y, $m, $d)

Takes the given year, month, and day, and turns it into a date object.  Month and day are
human-centric (i.e., 1-based, not 0-based).  Year should be a 4-digit year; if you pass in a 2-digit
year, you get a year bewteen 1900 and 1999, even if you use the last 2 digits of the current year.

=head3 Date::Easy::Date->new($obj)

If the sole argument to C<new> is a blessed object, attempts to convert that object to a date.
Currently the only type of object that can be successfully converted is a L<Time::Piece>.

=head3 today

Returns the current date (in the local timezone).

=head3 date($string)

Takes the human-readable string and converts it to a date using the following heuristics:

=over 4

=item *

If the string consists of exactly 8 digits, and the first two digits are between "10" and "28"
(inclusive), treats it as a compact datestring in the form YYYYMMDD.  Splits it up and passes year,
month, and day to C<new>.

=item *

Otherwise, if the string consists of nothing but digits (including an optional leading negative
sign), treats it as a number of epoch seconds and passes it to C<new>.

=item *

Otherwise, if the string contains no digits at all, removes any timezone specifier, then passes it
to L<Time::ParseDate>'s C<parsedate> function.  If the result is defined, passes the resulting epoch
seconds to C<new>.

=item *

Otherwise if the string contains some digits, passes it to L<Date::Parse>'s C<strptime> function.
If the resulting six values are defined and in the proper ranges, passes the year, month, and day to
C<new>.

=item *

Otherwise if the results of calling C<strptime> are unsatisfactory, removes any timezone specifier,
then passes it to L<Time::ParseDate>'s C<parsedate> function.  If the result is defined, passes the
resulting epoch seconds to C<new>.

=item *

If C<parsedate> returns C<undef> (in either position), throws an "Illegal date" exception.

=back

Though this sounds complicated, most of the time it just does what you meant and you don't need to
think about it.

=head2 Accessors

All accessors are inherited from L<Date::Easy::Datetime>, so refer to those docs.  Note that
C<hour>, C<minute>, and C<second> will always return 0 for a date object, and C<time_zone> will
always return 'UTC'.  Likewise, C<is_local> always returns false and C<is_utc> (and its alias
C<is_gmt>) always return true.

=head2 Overridden Methods

A few methods inherited from L<Date::Easy::Datetime> return different results in
C<Date::Easy::Date>.

=head3 split

Returns a list consisting of the year, month, and day, in that order, in the same ranges as returned
by the L<Date::Easy::Datetime/Accessors>.  This differs from datetime's C<split> in that the final
three elements (hours, minutes, and seconds) are omitted, since they're always zero.  Doesn't return
anything useful in scalar context, so don't do that.  Calling C<split> in scalar context may
eventually be changed to throw a warning or fatal error.

=head3 add_seconds

=head3 add_minutes

=head3 add_hours

=head3 subtract_seconds

=head3 subtract_minutes

=head3 subtract_hours

These methods throw exceptions if you call them for a date value, because they would adjust the time
portion, and the time portion of a date value must always be midnight.

=head2 Other Methods

All other methods are also inherited from L<Date::Easy::Datetime>, so refer to those docs.

=head2 Overloaded Operators

=head3 Addition

You can add an integer value to a date object.  It adds that number of days and returns a new date
object.  The original date is not modified.

=head3 Subtraction

You can subtract an integer value from a date object.  It subtracts that number of days and returns
a new date object.  The original date is not modified.

You can subtract one date from another; the result is the number of days you would have to add to
the right-hand operand to get the left-hand operand (therefore, the result is positive when the
left-hand side is a later date, and negative when the left-hand side is earlier).  Currently the
result of attempting to subtract a datetime from a date is undefined.


=head1 BUGS, CAVEATS and NOTES

Because a number like "20090120" can be either a compact datestring (20-Jan-2009) or  a valid number
of epoch seconds (21-Aug-1970 12:35:20), there is a range of epoch seconds that you cannot pass in
via C<date>.  That range is 26-Apr-1970 17:46:40 to 2-Dec-1970 15:33:19.

Any timezone portion specified in a string passed to C<date> is completely ignored.

If you pass a 2-digit year to C<date>, it will always come back in the 20th century:

    say date("2/1/17"); # Thu Feb  1 00:00:00 1917

Avoiding this is simple: always use 4-digit dates (which is a good habit to get into anyway).  This
could be considered a bug, since Time::Local uses a 50-year sliding window, which I<might> be
considered to be more correct behavior.  However, by suffering this "bug," we avoid a bigger one
(see L<RT/53413|https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=53413> and
L<RT/105031|https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=105031>).
