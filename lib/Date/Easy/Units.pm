# ABSTRACT: units objects for easy date/datetime math
# COPYRIGHT


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Date::Easy::Units ':all';

    my @units = (seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years);
    my $quarters = 3 * months;          # set the quantity (default: 1)
    my $year1 = 4 * $quarters;          # a year is 12 months
    my $year2 = 1 * years;              # `1 *' is redudant, but clearer

    # units stringify as you'd expect
    say 3 * weeks;
    # prints "3 weeks"
    say 1 * hours;
    # prints "1 hour"

    # $year1 and $year2 are _conceptually_ equal
    today + $year1 == today + $year2;   # true
    # but not _actually_ equal
    $year1 ne $year2;                   # because "12 months" ne "1 year"


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Date::Easy::Units objects represent a quantity and a unit: seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks,
months, or years.  The default quantity is 1, but you can multiply that by an integer (positive or
negative) to get a different quantity.  Multiplying a quantity other than 1 by an integer does what
you expect.

You I<could> create a units object the "normal" OOP way:

    my $s1 = Date::Easy::Units->new("seconds");
    my $m4 = Date::Easy::Units->new("minutes", 4);

But you will rarely do it that way.  More likely you'll just use the exportable (but not exported by
default) functions:

    my $s1 = seconds;
    my $m4 = 4 * minutes;

Arithmetic operators (plus and minus) can be used to add or subtract some amount of time to or from
a date or datetime.  Multiplcation can be used to change the quantity of a units object (as shown
above).

Units objects are immutable.

See L<Date::Easy> for more general usage notes.


=head1 USAGE

=head2 Import Parameters

You can request only certain of the constructors below be exported, or use C<:all> to get them all.

=head2 Constructors

=head3 seconds

=head3 minutes

=head3 hours

=head3 days

=head3 weeks

=head3 months

=head3 years

Each constructor returns a units object with the specified unit and a quantity of 1.  Multiply them
by an integer to get a different quantity.

=head3 new

Takes either one or two arguments: unit name (required) and quantity (optional).  Most of the time
you will not use this.

(Technically speaking, you can use C<new> to create any unit you want.  So you might:

    my $u = Date::Easy::Units->new("bmoogles");
    say $u;             # prints "1 bmoogle"
    say $u * 4;         # prints "4 bmoogles"
    my $d = my_date_thing();
    $d + $u * 4;        # calls $d->add_bmoogles(4)

and, assuming C<my_date_thing> returns an object with an C<add_bmoogles> method (and a
C<subtract_bmoogles> method), that will actually work.  Then you could even:

	sub bmoogles () { Date::Easy::Units->new("bmoogles") }
	say my_date_thing() + 4*bmoogles;

Not saying that any of that is a good idea, of course ... just that you I<could>, if you were so
inclined.)

=head2 Other Methods

=head3 to_string

Does the work of the overloaded stringification, in case you ever want to call it explicitly.

=head2 Overloaded Operators

=head3 Multiplication

Returns a new units object with the same unit and a quantity equal to the existing quantity times
the operand.  Thus, the operand should be an integer.  Multiplying by a floating point causes an
exception.  Multiplying by a string likely just gets you 0 (depending on whether your string can be
interpreted as a number), and probably a warning (if you have warnings turned on (which you
should)).

=head3 Addition

When you add a units object to a date (L<Date::Easy::Date>) or a datetime (L<Date::Easy::Datetime>),
it adds the appropriate number of the appropriate units to that date or datetime.  Thus:

    use Date::Easy;

    say datetime("2010-01-01 noon") + 3*hours + 39*minutes;
    # prints "Fri Jan  1 15:39:00 2010"
    say 14*weeks + date("2015-07-17");
    # addition is transitive: prints "Fri Oct 23 00:00:00 2015"
    say today + 14*hours;
    # throws exception: you can't add fractional days to a date
    say 3*months + 4*days;
    # throws exception: you can't add units to each other
    say now + 3*months + 4*days;
    # fine: addition is evaluated left-to-right

=head3 Subtraction

Subtracting a units object is just like adding the same units object times -1, except that of course
subtraction is not transitive.  So:

    use Date::Easy;

    say now - 14*hours;
    # fine
    say 14*hours - now;
    # throws exception: nonsensical


=head1 BUGS, CAVEATS and NOTES

This:

    use Date::Easy::Units ':all';

    say -1 * seconds;

prints "-1 seconds" as opposed to "-1 second."  Whether or not you consider that a bug depends on
where your concepts of arithmetic and grammar intersect.
